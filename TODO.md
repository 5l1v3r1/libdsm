== TODO file for libdsm

This TODO list is _far_ to be exhaustive but contains a few stuff that must be
done and i must not forget about.

* Replace OpenSSL by Public Domain code or libgcrypt
* Make libdsm work :D
* Refactor and make this code readable
* Support UTF8, right now we consider everything is ASCII
